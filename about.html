                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1729, Tyrrell County has a rich history that spans centuries. The area was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Chowanoke and Weapemeoc peoples. European settlers arrived in the late 17th century, establishing farms and plantations along the region's fertile land.</p>
                <p>During the Civil War, Tyrrell County played a strategic role due to its proximity to the Albemarle Sound and the vital waterways of eastern North Carolina. Today, visitors can explore historic sites such as Somerset Place, a former antebellum plantation that offers a glimpse into the area's plantation economy.</p>
